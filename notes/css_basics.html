<!-- EH CSS Basics 
 
What does CSS stand for?
 Cascading Style Sheets
If I have the same thing written 2 times, which one will happen?
 the last one said
What is a selector?
 tells us what you are changing
What is a declaration?
What is a property?
 the blue key (what is being changed in the selector)
What is a value?
 what it's being changed to
What is used instead of spaces?
 dashes -
How do you center text?
 text-align: center;
What are the 3 ways to change color on a page? (the 3 different formats, not what can be changed)
 rgb/rgba, hexadecimal, color name
Why would you not want to use a color's name to change the color? 
 its not specific
Where can you find the specific colors you want?
 in the slider once you have set a color
What are the different ways you can change the size of something? 
 font-size, width, em, veiw width(wv) or veiw height(hv)
Why would you want to set a size that automatically adjusts?
 so it looks good on different size screens and everything will be visable, no matter what someone is using.
