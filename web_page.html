        <h3>What even is Mistborn?</h3>
        <p><em>Mistborn</em> is a <strong>stellar</strong> book series by Brandon Sanderson. There are three books in the first arc: <em>The Final Empire, The Well of Assension,</em> and <em>The Hero of Ages.</em> The second arc, known as the Wax and Wayne series, currently has four books: <em>The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, The Bands of Mourning,</em> and <em>The Lost Metal.</em></p>
        <h3>What makes <em>Mistborn</em> so good?</h3>
        <p><em>Mistborn</em> is one of the most well thought out and intricate books I have ever read. The plot, characters, and twists are crafted in the most imersive way possible. The main character, Vin, is probably the most relatable character I have ever experienced being.</p>
